              your booking or enquiry.</li>
          </p>

          <h2>Pricing, Bookings and Payment</h2>
          <p>
            <li>All pricing is displayed and charged in New Zealand dollars and includes relevant taxes. Escape Quest
              reserves the right to alter published prices at any time.</li>
            <li>Only person(s) aged at least 18 years are permitted to book a game. Where a customer is booking tickets
              on
              behalf of themselves and other members of a group, that person must be authorised to make the booking on
              the
              basis of acceptance of these Terms and Conditions by all persons involved in the booking and by a parent
              or

            </li>
            <li>Customer safety is Escape Quest’s top priority. It’s important if you have a medical condition that you
              seek professional health advice prior to booking one of our escape rooms or VR experiences. Escape Quest
              does
              not take responsibility for customers’ medical conditions whilst playing at Escape Quest. Vertigo
              sufferers
              should note that VR escape games include moments of virtual climbing which gives the illusion of being
              high
              above the ground.</li>
            <li>Bookings and payment can be made online at www.escapequest.co.nz or in person at our premises. Payment
              for
              the escape game(s) will be due in full at the time of booking. Price and payment details will be confirmed
              during the booking process prior to payment and on your booking confirmation. Your chosen payment method
              will
              be charged as indicated during the booking and payment process.</li>
            <li>It is your responsibility to check that any booking details issued to you are accurate and your details
              are correct on the online booking form. By submitting an online booking form you warrant to Escape Quest

              all details supplied by you are true and accurate.</li>
            <li>Our acceptance of your booking will take place when your payment is processed successfully and you reach
              the booking confirmation page or are provided with a receipt on premise. At this point a contract will
              come
              into existence between you and us. We will also send you an email confirmation. Escape Quest will not send
              further confirmation via post or text message. Your booking confirmation is also your ticket to your
              mission
              and valid for up to the number of people shown on the booking confirmation.</li>
            <li>We accept the following methods of payment on our website, through our secure booking service supplier

          <h2>Cancellation, Rescheduling, Booking Changes and No-Shows</h2>
          <p>
            <li>Escape Quest hosts live experiences and once a booking is confirmed, we cannot accept cancellations or
              offer refunds.</li>
            <li>Re-scheduling your booking may be possible, but only at the discretion of Escape Quest. Rescheduling is
              free of charge provided you inform us at least 3 days in advance of your original booking date and is
              subject
              to availability. If less than 3 days notice is provided, we reserve the right to charge a $20 rescheduling
              fee. If, for whatever reason, we are unable to accommodate your booking on an alternative date, you will
              not
              be due a refund.</li>
            <li>If 3 or more days notice is provided at cancellation, issuing a voucher for the equivalent booking value
              to be used at a later date may be possible, but only at the discretion of Escape Quest.</li>
            <li>As Escape Quest is a live event with a scheduled start time, you are responsible for ensuring that all
              of
              your group of players arrive at the time stated on your booking confirmation, which is generally 10
              minutes
              before your game start time. Games will not be delayed for late arrivals, although we will allow late
              arrivals
              into the room after your escape game has begun, but not more than 15 minutes into the game. Please note
              that
              the 15 minutes cut-off time only applies to our escape rooms. For VR experience bookings you will be
              required
              to be all present for the start of the game.</li>
            <li>If your party has not arrived 15 minutes after your booked game start time, this will be treated as
              no-show and we may refuse entry to your game. No refund or rescheduling is available for no-shows.</li>
            <li>It is your responsibility to make your way to our business premises to play your game at the time stated
              on your booking confirmation. We do not provide parking or other travel arrangements and any travel
              information provided on our site is only done so as an aid to planning your visit. We cannot be held
              responsible for any failure of transport arrangements that result in your booking being a no-show.</li>
            <li>To the extent that you bring less players to Escape Quest than booked, the price difference will not be
              refunded. Please note that there is a minimum of two players required for any game.</li>
            <li>If more people attend the game than are booked (up to 6 persons per room) the extra can be paid prior to
              arrival (call us to add additional people on +64 3 442 4948) or upon arrival at the game.</li>
